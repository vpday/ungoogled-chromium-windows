# Windows Toolchain Configuration
# This file configures the Windows toolchain download and validation for cross-compilation builds.
#
# IMPORTANT: After the first successful build, update the sha512 value with the actual checksum
# of the generated .zip file in build/download_cache/
#
# To compute SHA512 on Linux:
#   sha512sum build/download_cache/<hash>.zip
#
# To compute SHA512 on Windows (PowerShell):
#   Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA512 build\download_cache\<hash>.zip
